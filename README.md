# **Credit card fraudulent detection using ML Algorithms : Logistic regression and SVM**
I performed the Logistic regression and SVM ( Support vector machine ) over the same dataset of credit card frauds which I downloaded from kaggle.

The collaboratory files attached above contans the step by step execution of the procedure as well as my remarks in the mark down cells after the code cells.

The link for the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

# **Conclusion**
After applying both the algorithm i.e, Logistic regression and the SVM on the dataset I came to conclusion that for a dataset which highly non-linear and is a multiclass dataset the SVM model is more robust and reliable in comparison to the logistic regression model.
