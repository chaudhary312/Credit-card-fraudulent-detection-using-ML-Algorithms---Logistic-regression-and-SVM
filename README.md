# **Credit_card_fraudulent_detection_using_ML_Algorithms : Logistic_regression_and_SVM**
I performed the Logistic regression and SVM ( Support vector machine ) classification techniques over the same dataset of credit card frauds which I downloaded from kaggle to find out which classifier is more suited for the purpose.

The collaboratory files attached above contans the step by step execution of the procedure as well as my remarks in the mark down cells after the code cells.

The link for the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

# **Concepts covered**
 1. Oversampling and undersampling 
 2. Lots of data visualization
 3. Logistic regression
 4. SVM ( Support vector machine )
 5. When to use SVM and Logistic reggression.

# **Conclusion**
After applying both the algorithm i.e, Logistic regression and the SVM on the dataset I came to conclusion that for a dataset which highly non-linear and is a multiclass dataset or simply one can say when a dataset is more complex then the SVM model is more robust and reliable in comparison to the logistic regression model for classification.
